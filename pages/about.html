                    <b>Newcoming</b> is an RP-heavy whitelist SMP set in a medieval fantasy setting where you get to write your own story and enjoy
                    stories created by others! Explore a vast and diverse continent where the borders between worlds have grown thinner. 
                    Are you a local traveller? A guest from another world? Would you rather settle in a kingdom or roam about, not tied 
                    down by anything? Learn from both the lands and the people and watch your story unfold.

                            Your builds are safe from griefing. Destruction of player-made structures can only happen if appropriate and justified in the story, if approved by the mod team. Accumulate claims blocks through playtime and protect your passion projects. Just make sure not to build eyesores – meteorite showers don’t spare anyone.

                                    Our map is 100% custom-built; 25k by 25k blocks total. The mainland continent covers about 19k by 14k blocks, but there are other islands out in the ocean to explore. Also, in the future, more islands may appear. There are a number of dungeons and other lore/quest locations with more to be added as the server goes on. Some might even be created by players themselves! To keep the lore of the world concise and to potentially help players with setting up their quests, all lore-altering additions to the world need to be approved by mod team.

                                    Players can create their own cities, nations and organizations! While there are some milestones one needs to reach to claim bigger titles (say, empire) or have significant help from mod team (altering claims, perks for members etc), there isn’t much stopping you from leaving a mark on this world.
                                    There is also a small number of admin-run nations and entities. You are free to interact with those just as you would with a player-run nation: interact, make alliances, make demands. Noone here is immune to war or conflicts, provided those make sense and are built up properly.
