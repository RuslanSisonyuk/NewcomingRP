                                In character, anyone that makes physical contact with any Aralume is able to "read" the thoughts that have been projected into it. The mind of the person touching it enters an "ethereal plane" that's full of other minds conversing. Canonically, a log of every thought that's been projected there is stored forever, and cannot be deleted or changed (that being said, if you make a typo, staff ain't gonna be mad if you fix it).
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                To "send a message," all a character has to do is focus, form a thought, then send it off (while touching an Aralume of course). These thoughts can include both words and images (so screenshots can be canon). However, "talented" users can "fake" images, so you shouldn't believe everything you see in there.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Also, you are able to differentiate between people speaking in the Aralume, as each person's soul is unique. Other than for very fringe circumstances, you will be able to recognize someone in the Aralume just as you would recognize them in person.

                                There are two "planes" within the Aralume, both of which are completely public. No private channels exist. There is the primary communication channel where all the talking takes place, and there is also the ùñ±√∫nata, AKA the announcements channel. There is a long cool-down between each message a person is allowed to send there so that important announcements aren't buried under regular conversation. Also, both IC and OOC, it is greatly frowned upon to post meaningless trite in the ùñ±√∫nata. You could experience either IC or OOC consequences for doing so. Maybe even both.

                                Since the Aralume transmits thoughts, this means that it acts as a translator of sorts. You can speak in other languages in the Aralume, BUT everyone that sees that message can understand it. To make this process easier, please include an OOC English (Common) translation next to any messages containing a different language, like Elvish.
