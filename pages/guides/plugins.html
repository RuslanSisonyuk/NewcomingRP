                                Upon being "killed," the dead player enters a downed state where they can be searched, picked up and carried, revived, or killed. As the victim, when downed you are set to half health, unable to break or place blocks, unable to eat or regenerate health, and unable to fight. You can yell for help, beg for mercy, or accept your fate by holding SHIFT - this will instantly kill you. Be warned when choosing death during a lore situation: you will be eligible for LORE DEATH based on your choice. As an onlooker, you can save a downed player by holding SHIFT near them and letting the revive timer fill up. Alternatively, right click to pick them up or SHIFT + right click to access their inventory. Be warned, downed players are canonically considered incapacitated, not unconscious; your actions will have consequences.

                                Got attacked? Don't log out! Combat tag is designed to prevent unfair and unrealistic escapes from fights. Logging out while combat tagged results in a fake player spawning in your stead - an immobile and defenseless avatar that your pursuers are free to kill. While combat tagged you also lose access to commands like /tpa, land claiming and more.

Run the command /glow gui : this will let you pick a color to glow as to clearly indicate to others that you are OOC. Any interactions while glowing like this are considered OOC, even if someone that isn't glowing interacts with you. Just make sure you pick a color other than white, as white is considered IC! Make sure not to use this command to escape plot ramifications or to leave an ongoing lore situation; such behaviors can result in a ban based on severity.

                                Players can use the /tpa command to teleport to each other both in AND out of character. However, this ability uses 20 levels of EXP. Also, if you are a part of a nation that has a National Anchor, you can warp to that Anchor for 20 levels.
