                                A Soul Anchor is used to validate a claim. To actually make a claim, you'll need to use a golden shovel. You can also use a stick to check if an area is already claimed.

                                Both Anchors exist to stabilize the claim magic people use to protect their belongings. The difference between the two is the strength of their influence.
                                Personal Soul Anchors take the mental attachment a person has to their home and channels that energy into protective magic that prevents outsiders from damaging their belongings. Each person by default has some amount of land they can protect with magic, but on its own, the magic is unstable and can randomly dissipate. Soul Anchors prevent this from happening.

                                National Anchors are basically a seriously buffed-up Soul Anchor, primarily intended for nations (as the name implies). It'll still be tied to a single person, but in order to activate, it will need influence from at least two OTHER people as well (3 in total; 2 + owner). While you can still share land that's protected by a Soul Anchor with other people, a National Anchor allows people to directly donate their claim magic to its owner.

                    <h4>Why would someone give up their own claim magic to someone else?</h4>

                                The directed will-power of many people is far more potent than the scattered desires of individuals. That's not a metaphor. Both types of Anchors can be overridden if enough will power from an aggressor is directed towards them. National Anchors are MUCH better at resisting these effects. Also, Soul Anchors can be tied directly to any National Anchor, as long as the owner of the respective National Anchor permits it. In that case, the National Anchor will have to be overridden before any of its Sub-Anchors can be attacked. 
                                Also...

                                There's certain areas of the map that handle claims a little differently; Facilities. Due to how coveted they are, there is a passive effect on these areas that prevents Soul Anchors from having any effect there. Even National Anchors struggle to protect them; they can only protect the general area around it and cannot support any Sub-Anchors. This means that if you want to claim a facility, you will either have to purchase a Nation Anchor DEDICATED to that Facility, OR settle your nation directly on top of the Facility, which is stupidly risky as anyone can declare a siege on a Facility to take it over.

                    <h4>Speaking of Sieges...</h4>
                    <section class="infopost-section-chapter">

                                If someone wants to do your home harm, they'll have to have enough willpower (admin-approved justification) to do it, especially if it's a National Anchor that isn't protecting a facility. During a siege, the Anchor will become unstable and anyone with a pickaxe and break it apart (the Anchor is the only thing allowed to be destroyed during a siege by default). If it's completely destroyed, you'll lose your protection magic in that area completely.

                    <h4>Anchor Access</h4>
                    <section class="infopost-section-chapter">

                                Finally, before anyone gets any bright ideas, you can't just bury your anchor out of reach of potential attackers. Anchors have to have access to the world around them if they're gonna be able to protect it (sieges must be possible without griefing). Not saying you have to leave it out in your garden, but you can't just have it in a box with no way in or out. Your protection will dissipate REAL fast if you do that. Doors are fine though, as long as they can be opened by attackers during a siege.
