                                The continent of Penora is quite large, having many distant locations players frequently travel to. 
                                Usually travel using horses and speed foods such as the Kozinac are enough for short and mid distance travel, but often you might have the urgency to get to the other side of the continent quickly. You can use the <b>/tpa</b> command (teleport to player), 
                                which <b>is considered to be In Character</b> and costs 20 experience levels and a few seconds of standing still.

                                    You can also build <b>ships, airships, railroads, and even portals</b> (if you're rich enough), in addition to the many ones already present around. While the ships and things don't actually move themselves, if you construct a ship at one port for example, and then a duplicate one at ANOTHER port (or ports!) staff will create warp signs for players to use (just let us know!). There will be a bit of a delay for the warp to actually take place as you "travel," but it'll certainly be a lot faster than walking. Also, if a player is rich enough to create a portal (<b>4 Netherite blocks</b> per portal), they will function just the same as the ones at spawn do (i.e., stand in it for 4 seconds to teleport).

                                <b>1.</b> ALL forms of transportation will require the proper infrastructure in order to function. If you want a ship warp, that ship will need to have proper access to whatever the other location is. This means a canal, river or other body of water wide and deep enough to allow passage of that ship. If you want to build a railroad, it must be connected all the way across and be structurally sound (railroads must look nice! No lazy minerails with no protection from mobs or lighting, or senseless boring through the ground or mountains). If you want to build an airship, you and the people working on it will need to be smart enough engineers to make sure the thing doesn't crash between flights (airships take a LOT of time and effort to build!).    
                            </p>

                                <b>2.</b> For ships and airships, the SIZE and QUALITY of the build will be what determines the RANGE of its allowable warps, as well as how long the warp takes to complete. Because of this, it is recommended you contact staff before constructing these, as you do not want to build 2 ships in 2 different places only to find out that they're not large enough to meet the size requirement for the requested range. It's hard to put an exact number on this, so for now, this will be handled case-by-case. For railroads, this does not apply as distance is much more directly tied to how much building is required.    
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                <b>3.</b> Ships and airships have a soft maximum range of 10,000 blocks. Exceptions may potentially be made for exceptionally impressive builds. For ships, this is calculated by how much distance in water it will have to travel, NOT a direct straight line. [THE SECTION IN BRACKETS IS STILL UNDER TESTING. THIS COULD CHANGE. Airships can travel in a straight line, but have a fuel requirement based on the distance of the trip.] Once again, the range limit does not apply for railroads, though you should have "stops" at stations along the way (about every 10,000 blocks worth of rail minimum). All "travel times" between warps are affected by the distance-to-build quality/size ratio. For example, if you have a very large ship that only travels 2,000 blocks, well below its maximum range, the travel time would be shorter than a 10,000 block trip on the same ship. Portals have no range limit and are all 4 seconds.

                                For both game design reasons as well as lore reasons, Newcoming does NOT allow players to access any dimension other than the Overworld.
