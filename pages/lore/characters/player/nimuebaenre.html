                                            Nimue Argorim was born a Qu'Essan, or Princess, of House Baenre, a noble house of the Dark elves. She was not fully raised in the Underdark, but she was taught the ways of her people, or half her people... She was born Half Moon elf, and Half Drow. 
                                            Nimue was forced to do horrible things by her father- <i> most of which consisted of killing the people she cared about. </i> One day- her sister decided that enough was enough- and helped Nimue escape the realm that she was born into. Arriving in Penora, Nimue was lost and confused- but she was free. 
                                            But now... months after arriving in Penora- something has changed, more importantly, Nimue had changed. She was no longer a Drow, or a Moon elf- she was something else entirely. A Faelari Gray Elf. '[this is a TLDR]'

                                To be frank- Nimue used to be a raging <i>bitch</i>. Now, she is kind and caring. She looks out for her friends and family, but due to her past- tends to be quiet, and stutters at times.

                                    <p>Nimue is short for her race, and always has to look up, literally, to others. Her ears are pointed- close to a leaf shape. She has floor length white hair that she constantly keeps in a braid... typically for the convinience. She has amber, almost golden, irises that seem to peer into your soul. Her face has a kind expression to it. You would hardly be able to tell
                                        that she used to be a dark elf from another land. She had pale purple skin- and long ears. She has kept her long hair from then- but her sclera used to be almost pitch black. Now,they are white. She wears light colors, and tries to avoid wearing dark tones, as they remind her of her old self.

                            <p> Highest form of education where she comes from ,due to being of royal descent. And she is pretty well versed in spellwork, though tends to not use magic unless absolutely necessary, as she is not a big fan of magic.
                                Since she is a part of the royal family she is well versed in War Strategies.
                                She is in love with learning different languages and understanding their cultures, so she knows:

                                Born Seventh in line to the throne, Nimue has not once thought of ascending, though she does act like a proper princess when amongst court. When she is with close friends, she can be quite talkative and cunning. She loves her family, and prioritizes her siblings' health over her own. 
                                One day, while learning new spells with her sister, Aeloria, things had gotten rather strange, when they decided to go into the forbidden library of the castle. She had been looking into the spell section that regarded demons and other infernal beasts, when she heard her sister shout. 
                                When Nimue peered around the bookshelf and saw her sister struggling to contain a spell, she ran into action attempting to save her. Unfortunately for Nimue, the spell had hit her directly. 
                                The moment after impact, Nimue was blinded by the sun, which had seemed strange, but it's what happens when you go from being in a dank room, to a field of poppies all of the sudden.

                            <p>Her Mother, Aurelia Baenre, is a high elf with the Moon elf subrace. She is a part of the high royal family in Nimue’s home world. Her father, Kyorlin Baenre, had married Aurelia to form a peace treaty between both of their respective kingdoms. 
                                While they live in the kingdom of Aegeon, the moon elf nation, they rule over both of their respective realms. She is close with her parents, but seeing as she is the seventh child, having five brothers, Imbros first in line, Bemril second in line, Nyloth the fourth in line, Zeerith the sixth in line, and her younger brother Galavern, who was the eigth in line. 
                                And with two sisters, Aeloria the third in line, and Ryelith the fifth in line, she most likely would not be seated on the throne.</p>

                                <h4> Nimue's <i>Oath</i>:</h4>
                                <p>
                                    Nimue was controlled by her father, Kyorlin, to kill her friends, family, and any he deemed were not someone he could control. Nimue was trapped in something that was called a 'Webbed Oath'. She was forced to do his bidding, she had no control over her self at this time.
                                    <i> And even if she did- he had taken her empathy- so she did not care-</i> In order for Nimue to break free of this curse, she had to remember those that her father made her kill and remember their names. As he had made her forget any of the victims that she had been close with.
                                </p>
                                <li>First Victim: drow man, black hair. Short, lean, and is full of anger, screaming about her father. She was her younger brother.  HIS NAME WAS GALAVERN when he was living, he was like ORION, Kind, caring, but misunderstood. 
                                    Because of his black hair, he was seen as a bad omen, and the moment he snapped. Even just a little, nimue was forced to kill him.</li>
                                <li>Second Victim: moon elf woman. She was a noble woman that Nimue fell in love with. She was trustworthy, and she was determined to escape the noble life. The woman wanted to take nimue with her, to escape the castles and the lies. 
                                    This woman had pale skin, and pure white hair. Her eyes were green with golden flecks (with white sclera). She was taller than Nimue, and she loved nature. She wanted to open an apothecary, but before the two of them escaped, Nimue’s father forced her to poison her love.
                                    Her name was Syltris Ilphastra. She called nimue her little water lily. (nimue called her sylphy)</li>
                                <li>Third Victim: Her betrothed. He was a tall elven man. Originally from a high house, but since his house fell, and her father saw that he would not gain anything from the marriage, he had nimue kill him, instead of calling it off. 
                                    His name was Kor’Elar Oussath. He would never yell, and he was kind. He had a soft tone to his voice, and he cared deeply for Nimue, and understood that her father was forcinger her to do horrible things.
                                    Kor was poisoned by her. <i> This is the Elf that Nime first confused Caraphind for-</i></li>
                                <li>Fourth Victim: Her old childhood best friend- a member of court from the moon elves. Not one of high renown, but was born the same year that Nimue was. She loved languages just like Nimue, and was very inquisitive about things. 
                                    she had pale blue skin- and black hair- her name was Aruna Ithylwen. She had found out what nimue’s father was doing to her- and was going to tell the rest of the court about the situation.
                                    </li>
                                <li>Fifth Victim: Nimue's Lady in waiting. She was human Named Elwyn Timmens She had brown hair- blue eyes. She loved to sew- and was genuinely kind to nimue- 
                                    she was killed because she witnessed the death of Aruna, and was going to take what Aruna’s evidence to others- before she was killed by nimue. (she was pushed off a high building, by a ledge- so it would look like she had taken her own life.)</li>
                                <li>Sixth Victim: Her language mentor who was a human man, around 50 years of age, he had long gray hair- brown eyes. Anthony Lowstone- was gentle with her- but could get upset quickly- was killed because he witnessed Nimue’s father trigger the spell- Death by stabbing.</li>
                                <li>Seventh Victim: The head maid, a black haired woman- her hair is tied up into a bun. She is a moon elf- with fair blue tinted skin. She is the one that raised Nimue. Gentle silvery eyes. She was willing to help nimue break the oath- as she had found out about it secretly. 
                                    She was killed by nimue during the night- using a hair comb that she had given her. Her name was Velesti Elmsworn-. </li>
                                <li>Eigth Victim: A young tiefling girl that Nimue had cared for. She had brown hgair reddish colored horns, and a warm copper skintone. Her eyes had a fiery orange shade to them that seemed to be filled with hope. Nimue had named this child- Her father made her strangle the child in the mountains... 
                                    She was only 6 years of age... Her name was Ialys, and Nimue called her <i>her smile-</i>
