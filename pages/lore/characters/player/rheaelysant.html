                                            Rhea Elysant, born Astraea del Ademora, is a curious individual that was brough into this world on Winter 21 over a thousand years ago. She grew up with her family and the community of her people. One day, a raid occured on her home, masked men burned down the forest that she and her people resided in- and took a plethora of them as hostages. 
                                            At the time Rhea had white hair and silvery eyes, so the people that had captured her, and the ones that sold her, believed they could convince a kingdom that she was an angel of sorts. Was she an angel? No.

                            <p> Rhea never had any proper “human education” but was taught things when she was young by her parents. During her thousand year journey to learn more about the land she resides on, she has learned a basic (college level) education. She has spent a lot of her time learning about the flora and fauna of her land, and came to Penora to learn about the flora and fauna here.
                                Rhea knows a few languages, and is always willing to learn more. She knows the following languages:</p>

                            <p>• Aquan             • Common           • Dwarvish</p>

                            <p>
                                Rhea, formally known as Astraea, was born in Ayrwode forest, and while her species can live for thousands of years, when she was young, her people were hunted. The humans of the land thought of the Ademora as angels, and even though they weren’t the humans would do anything to either own one of her kind, or have their wings. </p>
                               <p> At a young age for her people, roughly two-hundred years, there was a raid on her village. In the process her mother and father were killed for trying to protect her. She was captured and sold in a black market auction to a noble. She became his trophy wife, and was basically forced to live in a glass cage. After he “acquired her” he believed that all of his actions and deeds were permitted by the gods, and that as long as he treated her well, he could do no wrong in the gods’ eyes. </p>
                               <p> After he had passed away, the people of the nobles' land believed her to be a demon. They believed that since she barely aged from the day that she was captured fifty years ago, and since their ‘pure hearted’ nobleman became corrupted, it was her fault. In a fit of rage, they took her from her cage and ripped her wings out of her back. In agony she watched as her only hope for true freedom was burned in front of her.</p>
                               <p> Once the mob of people had left her to die, feeling as though they saved their nobleman’s soul, a young servant girl, who was only taken in at the end of the nobles life, came to her and took her to the servant quarters to recover. During this time, Astraea picked up the nasty habit of napping for long periods of time, more than once she had slept for a few days straight. </p>
                               <p> Once her wounds healed, since the man she lived with bore no children, a new noble had taken over the estate; when they arrived, they had fired most of the staff, making the servant girl disappear. 
                              <p> Astraea then decided it was in her best interest to escape. Now that she no longer had her wings, she passed as an elf.</p>
                              <p> After she escaped, Astraea took her time exploring to help understand people and the world that she lived in. It was her hope that not everyone was like the noble that she came across. </p>
                              <p> Astraea had traveled the continent, and the seas before she came across her home again. This time it was unrecognizable. The forest that she had seen as lush and green had become a field. With only one tree remaining. It had taken her more than a hundred years for her to get back home, and she came back to ruins, artifacts of a place she had spent her childhood.</p>
                              <p> Seeing as her home was no more, she continued on her journey, taking in everything she could get her eyes/hands on.</p>
                              <p> After she finished exploring the land she comes from, she traveled to this continent, Penora, to start a new journey.</p>
