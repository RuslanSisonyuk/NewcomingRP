                                Something to keep in mind: we're pretty thorough with our reviews, so don't get too sad if your application gets rejected. That being said, you will be allowed to have multiple attempts on your application if you get rejected the first time.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                How do you if your application gets rejected? Well, if it gets accepted, you'll be given the Approved role and pinged. If you notice that you can submit another application, but you haven't gotten the role, this means you've been rejected. Don't fret! There is a 2 week cooldown between applications. You're free to submit another one at any time, but we will not re-check your application until after the 2 week period. Best to make sure you take your time on your second attempt!     
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Using AI to assist you in writing your application is not allowed. If you use it in small ways, like to help you come up with names, that's fine. However, if we can tell a bot did part of your application, it's getting rejected.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                If you have any questions about the character creation section, staff are here to guide you. However, the rest of the application will need to be done by you and only you.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Finally, we generally accept apps as they come in. This could change in the future, but there's normally only around a 24-72 hour waiting period between the time you submit it and the time you'll know if you've gotten in or not. I'll edit this part of the message if that time frame changes.

                                    Characters reliant on Sci-Fi/modern technology. For example, we will not approve lore involving mech suits, computers, guns, phones, etc. For science-based characters, please use steampunk as the top cutoff line for how advanced tech can be.

This includes but is not limited to copying Christianity, retelling history books or modern history, making your character from a real world location (the reality that our server takes place in is COMPLETELY separate from real life!) borrowing recognizable characters and settings from books, movies etc. Drawing inspiration from IRL cultures, myths etc., however, is allowed.

                                    Characters that have any sort of innate ability that makes them inherently more powerful than others. Power is something that must be EARNED on our server, it is not given through your backstory. Even then, certain things like necromancy, flight, immortality, ability to reincarnate, anything that would allow people to bypass our lore death rules, mind control, etc. will just be outright denied.

                    <h4>Rules of thumb for characters</h4>
                    <section class="infopost-section-chapter">
                        <div class="paragraph-container">
                            <p>
                                Our playerbase is comprised of quite a diverse collection of species. That being said, we do NOT allow for anything and everything. The rule of thumb is keeping your characters' power level, attributes and abilities (even if confined to roleplay) reasonable and comprehensible. The further you deviate from a "default human", the harder it is to approve the character.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Now, that does NOT mean we only allow humans, or that applying as something that isn't human is inherently hard. For example, things like dwarves, elves and anthropomorphic animals are more or less "flavor" to what's otherwise a base human - those are fine. Such origins do not bear inherent implications for world lore. What's not so fine is applying as a demon god from hell. Such character can be played out in abidance with all the other rules, however the sheer existence of such characters raises a ton of questions. Why is this "demon god" just as weak as a mortal now? Is hell real? How did he get here? Can he get back? Can he get his power back?
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Generally speaking, any sort of "divine," "demonic," or "ethereal" characters will be MUCH more heavily scrutinized. 
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Another thing we're very hesitant to approve of are characters with multiple "souls." This has been used to try to bypass certain limitations and rules we have in place, and is rarely played out well. Such characters typically result in overcomplicated lore. So, while it isn't explicitly banned, it's very difficult to get approved.
